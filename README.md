# music-clustering
In this work, we employed an unsupervised learning paradigm to understand how musical genres can be grouped. We worked with dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA and UMAP, as well as clustering models like KMeans, Mean-Shift, and hierarchical clustering. Our results highlighted attributes such as musical mode, explicitness, energy, and acoustics as relevant for the clustering problem. Despite the significant variance in attributes within the same genre, we consistently found a similar grouping of genres across all clustering models. Thus, we foresee that our work could not only be a powerful tool for the quantified understanding of musical genres but also for data scientists seeking ways to preprocess their data for classification tasks.
